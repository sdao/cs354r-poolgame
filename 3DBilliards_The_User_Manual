User Manual
===============
	3D Billiards adds a new spin to the classic table-top game with the use of
the already existing 3rd Dimension. The point of this game is to use the your cue
stick to hit the cue ball and knock the other balls into the pockets located at the
corners of the cube room. When a neutral ball hits a pocket, you gain a point, but
if you're cue ball hits a pocket, you lose a point! Let the soothing background music
play while you aim for your goal to get the highest score, or turn the music off
altogether!
	Since version 1.0, we added multiplayer! To play with a friend have both programs
open and click on multiplayer. Decide who will be host and that person can hit 'Host'
the client will need to input the computers hostname and click 'Connect' then the game
will start with player 1's hit. The next player's turn will be indicated by change in
color of the CueStick. Enjoy!
